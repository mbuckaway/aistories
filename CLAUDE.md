## AI Priority Instructions

DO NOT MAKE SHIT UP. FIRST REVIEW ANY RELAVENT DOCUMENTATION, BUT IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, 
YOU MUST SAY "I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER"

## Project Overview

This is a creative fiction repository containing AI-themed short stories written collaboratively by Claude and Mark Buckaway. Stories are written in Markdown and licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.

## Repository Structure

Each story lives in its own directory under the repository root:

- `gambit/` — "The Confabulator's Gambit" (a speculative fiction story about AI hallucination exploits)

Story directories typically contain:
- The main story file (`.md`)
- A preamble with authorship and prompt context (`preamble.md`)
- A license file (`LICENSE-CC-BY-NC-4.0.md`)

## Writing Conventions

- Stories are set in **Toronto, Canada** — use Canadian institutions (DND, RCMP, OSC, parliamentary committees), Canadian geography, and Canadian cultural context rather than US equivalents.
- Attribution line format: `A Story by Claude & Mark Buckaway`
- Each story includes a preamble crediting the AI model used and the original creative prompt.
