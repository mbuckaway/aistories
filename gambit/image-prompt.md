## Prompt

A lone woman sits in a dark room, her face illuminated by the cold blue-white glow of three computer monitors arranged in a semicircle. The room is sparse and low-rent — bare walls, exposed pipes, a single desk cluttered with papers and coffee cups. Through a small window behind her, the faint neon haze of a San Jose street at night is visible. On the center monitor, a command-line terminal shows a blinking cursor. On the left monitor, a web of interconnected corporate documents and network diagrams. On the right monitor, cascading red alert indicators are beginning to spread across a map of data center locations. Her hands rest on the keyboard, poised, deliberate. The mood is tense and solitary — one person about to set something irreversible in motion. Cinematic lighting, high contrast, digital noir aesthetic.

## Style Notes

- Do **not** include any text, logos, watermarks, or lettering in the image.
- Aim for a photorealistic or cinematic digital-art style, not cartoonish or illustrative.
- The woman should not be identifiable as any real person.
- Keep the composition horizontally oriented (landscape) for Medium's layout.
