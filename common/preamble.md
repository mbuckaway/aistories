# Preamble

**This story is a work of fiction.** All characters, companies, organizations, events, and technologies depicted are entirely imaginary. Any resemblance to real persons, companies, or events is coincidental. The technical concepts discussed are dramatized for narrative purposes and do not represent a blueprint for any real-world exploit.

**About the creation of this story:**

"The Confabulator's Gambit" — *Every AI system has the same fatal flaw. This story is about what happens when someone exploits it.* — was written by **Claude Opus 4.6**, an AI language model created by Anthropic, with creative direction and guidance from a human collaborator.

As a software developer, I spend my days writing code, not prose. I have ideas — sometimes big, strange, speculative ones — that I'd love to explore through fiction, but I don't have the creative writing skills or the time to develop them into polished narratives. AI changes that equation. It lets me act as a director — shaping the concept, the tone, the themes — while a capable (if non-human) collaborator does the actual wordsmithing. Think of it as guiding a student writer: I know what I want the story to say, and the AI helps me say it.

I'm sharing the original prompt below so that anyone curious can feed it to their AI of choice and see what emerges. Different models will interpret the same seed differently, and that's part of what makes this interesting.
