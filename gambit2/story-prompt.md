## The Original Prompt

Take the original version of The Confabulator's Gambit and the plausibility assessment identifying its plot holes, and rewrite the story to plug those holes. The revised version should address: the implausible self-sustaining feedback loop, the unrealistic financial collapse timeline, the legally questionable jury acquittal, the impossible "no kill switch" design, and the unjustified level of infrastructure agency given to the model. Create a more believable story while preserving the core themes.

Set the story in the US centered around Silicon Valley. Use US institutions.
